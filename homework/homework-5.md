# Homework 5

1. Make sure you can follow the recursion example on the Cairo playground
2. Does this example use tail recursion?
3. Install the Argent X and Braavos wallet and create an account : how does this account differ to an Ethereum EOA?

# Solutions

1. It does.
2. It doesn't as the recursive call isn't the last thing the function does.
3. They differ because the first transaction that's sent is a deploy transaction.
