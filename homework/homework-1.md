## Maths introduction

### Some modular arithmetic

1. Working with the following set of integers S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. What is
    - 4 + 4
    - 3 x 5 
    - the inverse of 3?
2. For S defined as above, can we consider S and the operation '+' to be a group?
3. What is -13 mod 5?

## Solutions
ðŸš¨ Solutions are provided assuming that the + and x operations are defined modulo 7ðŸš¨

1.   
    - 4 + 4 â‰¡<sub>7</sub> 1
    - 3 x 5 = 15 â‰¡<sub>7</sub> 1
    - As shown above, 3 * 5 â‰¡<sub>7</sub> 1 &rarr; 5 is the inverse of 3
2.
    Yes, as all properties of the groups hold:
    - '+' is commutative and associative
    - the neutral element of '+' 0 belongs to S
    - for each element of the group, there exists an inverse
3.
    -13 â‰¡<sub>5</sub> 15 - 13 â‰¡<sub>5</sub> 2
